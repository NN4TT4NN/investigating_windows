# [Investigating Windows](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/investigatingwindows) 

This repository is dedicated to show how i go through Hacking challenges.
Created only for learning pourposes and all the solutions and tricks are used at controlled environments.
Happy Hacking üòÉ

A windows machine has been hacked, its your job to go investigate this windows machine and find clues to what the hacker might have done.

Connect to the machine using RDP. The credentials the machine are as follows:

###### Username: Administrator

###### Password: letmein123!

#### So let's get started phreaks üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

* If you're going to connect to the Windows machine remotely, don't forget to setup your VPN config file and make shure your connection is running, good? üëç
  
* First of all, i'll be connecting to the remote windows machine using RDP, but you can just start the Windows machine at [Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/investigatingwindows) by clicking the green "Start Machine" button üí°


#### I'm at a Kali Linux Machine, so the command is ‚¨áÔ∏è
  
````
xfreerdp /v:<victim_machine_ip> /u:Administrator /p:letmein123!
````

<img src="screenshots/setup_rdp_scr_width.png" width=700 height="auto"/>

* You'll be asked if you wanna trust the certificate, make shure you type "y" and click enter üëç
* There's also a width and height option that you can pass if you want.

### Questions

1. ### Whats the version and year of the windows machine?
    
    <img src="screenshots/question01.png" width=700 height="auto"/>
    <img src="screenshots/question01_answer.png" width=700 height="auto"/>

    * First one is easy, just type "systeminfo" and it gives to you all computer's basic information.


2. ### Which user logged in last?
    
    * For this one first we need to know how many users are in the victim's machine.
    * The command for this is the following:
  
        ````
        net user
        ````
    <img src="screenshots/listing_accounts.png" width=700 height="auto"/>

    * Now you know all of them!
    * And it takes us to the next command to see who logged in before us.
    * There's many ways you can do this specially in Windows machines, navigating by the interface.
    * But, we are hackers, we should really know how to manage different commands into any terminal.
    * The command below, shows the login of the "administrator" user  ‚¨áÔ∏è
    ````
    net user "administrator" | findstr /B /C:"Last logon"  
    ````
    <img src="screenshots/adm_last_logon.png"/>

    * But, just like i said, we're hackers, we want something more.
    * So let's create a script to return all users last logins into our terminal:
    
    ````
    @echo off

    for %%u in (John Administrator Jenny Guest DefaultAccount) do (
        echo %%u:
        net user %%u | findstr /B /C:"Last logon"
        echo.
    )

    ````
    * First we need to know where we are, do let's run a dir:
    
    <img src="screenshots/dir.png" width="700"/>

    * You can change directories if you want, but i'm kipping this one.
    * Now lets create the file :
    ````
    echo "hello" > check_logon.bat
    ````
    <img src="screenshots/create_check_logon_file.png" width="700"/>

    * Now you can open notepad and start creating your script:
    ````
    notepad check_logon.bat
    ````
    <img src="screenshots/opened_notepad.png" width="700"/>
    <img src="screenshots/bat_script.png" width="700"/>

    * Save the file.
    * Now go back to the terminal and run the file:
  
    <img src="screenshots/script_output.png" width="700"/>

    * And there it is, our last logged in user is "Administrator":

    <img src="screenshots/question02_answer.png" width="700"/>

3. ### When did John log onto the system last?
   
   * The answer for this one is in the last answer:

    <img src="screenshots/john_last_logon.png" width="700"/>
    
    <img src="screenshots/question03_answer.png" width="700"/>
  

4. ### What IP does the system connect to when it first starts?
   
   * For this you need to watch when the you start the machine, there will be an ip showing up to the screen.

    <img src="screenshots/first_ip_conn.png" width="700"/>

    <img src="screenshots/question04_answer.png" width="700"/>

5. ### What two accounts had administrative privileges (other than the Administrator user)?
   
   * First thing about this you need to know is .... users belongs to groups.
   * So, if i'm logged in as Administrator, i can see what groups are there and which one i'm part of.
   * And that's an easy task:
  
    <img src="screenshots/admin_group.png" width="700"/>
  
   * And now it's easy to find who has the same level of access that you have:
  
    <img src="screenshots/administrators.png" width="700"/>

   * There it is, our question number 5:
    
    <img src="screenshots/question05_answer.png " width="700"/>
   
6. ### Whats the name of the scheduled task that is malicous?

   * Windows machines have a "Task Scheduler"
   * And we're taking a look at this tasks
   * For this you can click at "Windows" key or icon and type "task scheduler"
   * It'll show you something like this
  
    <img src="screenshots/task_scheduler.png" height="700"/>
    
   * You click in "Task Scheduler" and you'll be directed to the scheduler screen
   * Take your time and look to all the files there
   * Certanly you'll reach the same result as mine
   * There is a file called "Clean file system"
   * It runs every day at 4:55 PM 

    <img src="screenshots/malicious_task.png" width="900"/>

   * And now we can take a good look at the "Actions" tab 
    
    <img src="screenshots/malicous_task_actions.png" width="900"/>

   * As you can see, this file runs a PowerShell task
   * And to have the full knowledge about whats going on with that file
   * Let's take a closer look
   * So we navigate to that path where the ".ps1" file is located
   
    <img src="screenshots/nc_malicious_script.png" width="900"/>
   
   * I chose to open it with "Notepad" to see what it does

    <img src="screenshots/nc_code.png" width="900"/>

   
   * And there it is ... a malicious code that involves running a Python script that listens for a connection and, upon receiving a connection, executes commands on the connecting machine. This behavior is characteristic of a reverse shell, a type of shell where the target machine initiates the connection to the attacker's machine, allowing the attacker to execute commands on the target machine remotely.

7. ### What file was the task trying to run daily?

    This is answered in the last question:

    
    <img src="screenshots/malicous_task_actions.png" width="900"/>


    ````
    nc.ps1
    ````

    <img src="screenshots/question07_answer.png" width="900"/>


8. ### What port did this file listen locally for?

    This is in the question number 06 too.
    If you double click at the malicious task, the screen below opens to you:

    <img src="screenshots/nc_command_port.png" width="900"/>

    Take a look at the command:

    ````
    C:\TMP\nc.ps1 -l 1348
    ````

    What it does is execute the file >>> C:\TMP\nc.ps1

    Then tells it to listen to some port >>> -l

    And finally the port that will receive some interaction >>> 1348
